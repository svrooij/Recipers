# Token validation

1. Have signing keys cached?
1. If not, fetch OpenID Configuration
1. Fetch JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)
1. Validate token against keys
1. Validate lifetime & other claims

# Inject extra signing keys

1. Modify the `authority` to point to the proxy
1. Act as a proxy for OpenID Configuration
1. Change the `jwks_uri` to point to the proxy
1. Act as a proxy for JWKS
1. Inject extra signing keys into the JWKS response

# Get token during tests

1. Ask the proxy for a token with these claims
1. Proxy fetches OpenID Configuration and JWKS
1. Proxy generates an extra signing key
1. Proxy signs the token with the extra key
1. Proxy returns the token to the test
1. API validates the token as usual
